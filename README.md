# Talking Fish â€” mouth animation by microphone loudness

This is a tiny static site that shows a single mouth image and updates it based on your microphone loudness. Place your mouth images in `images/talkImages/` named `mouth1.jpg`, `mouth2.jpg`, ... The lowest number is closed, highest is open.

This is mostly generated with AI and is incredibly stupid. I swear I'm better than this but I don't have a website at the moment and putting static pages on github is easy.
